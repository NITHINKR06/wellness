# Working Overview

This website is designed as a gentle companion for pregnant and postpartum women. It offers a guided questionnaire that helps visitors reflect on how they have been feeling, noticing patterns in mood, energy, and support. After answering, the site provides clear, friendly feedback that highlights whether someone might benefit from reaching out for extra care.

Beyond the check-in, the site keeps a personal history of past assessments so users can see how their feelings change over time. It also highlights trustworthy mental health resources and encourages conversations with family members or healthcare professionals, making it easier to seek help when needed.
